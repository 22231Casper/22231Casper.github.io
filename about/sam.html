    <p>Sam is the Content Manager of Cappamart. He is a certified wubungulator that mostly plays games that give him the most creative freedom as possible like his personal favourite Pirate Game and his second favourite which is Baldur's Gate 3. He joined this circus due to his skill with writing dumb paragraphs and collecting/creating images, audio and of course some general coding.</p>
